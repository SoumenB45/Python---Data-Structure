## 1. String Slicing

**Question:** Discuss string slicing and provide examples.

**Overview:** This section explains how to slice strings in Python, including different techniques to access substrings. Examples illustrate how to use positive and negative indices.

## 2. Key Features of Lists

**Question:** Explain the key features of lists in Python.

**Overview:** This section covers the characteristics of lists, such as mutability, dynamic sizing, and support for various data types. Examples demonstrate how lists are used in Python programming.

## 3. Accessing, Modifying, and Deleting Elements in a List

**Question:** Describe how to access, modify, and delete elements in a list with examples.

**Overview:** Here, you'll find methods to access, modify, and delete list elements, with practical examples showcasing list indexing, slicing, and built-in methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`.

## 4. Comparison of Tuples and Lists

**Question:** Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples.

**Overview:** This section highlights the differences and similarities between tuples and lists, focusing on mutability, performance, and usage scenarios. Examples provide clarity on when to use tuples versus lists.

## 5. Key Features of Sets

**Question:** Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use.

**Overview:** This part explains the unique characteristics of sets, such as unordered elements, no duplicates, and efficient membership tests. Examples illustrate how to create and use sets in Python.

## 6. Use Cases of Tuples and Sets

**Question:** Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.

**Overview:** This section covers practical use cases for tuples and sets, such as using tuples for fixed data and sets for membership checks and unique data handling.

## 7. Working with Dictionaries

**Question:** Describe how to add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary with examples.

**Overview:** In this section, you'll learn how to manage dictionary items, including adding new key-value pairs, updating existing values, and removing entries using methods like `update()`, `del`, and `pop()`.

## 8. Importance of Dictionary Keys

**Question:** Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.

**Overview:** This section explains why dictionary keys must be immutable, with examples demonstrating the role of hashable types in ensuring dictionary keys' integrity.

## Conclusion

This assignment provides a comprehensive overview of Python data structures and their applications. Each section includes examples and explanations to reinforce the concepts discussed.
